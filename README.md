## 🧑‍🎓 I'm Divesh Jadhwani,
A student of MCA specializing in AI and DS. I'm passionate about technology and love exploring the fascinating world of IoT and embedded systems. Currently, I'm working on a project to build a humanoid robot 🤖, and I'm also diving into the exciting field of bio-neural data analysis 🧠, specifically EEG data samples.

🌱 While I'm still learning, I'm always eager to collaborate and work on projects with others 🤝. So, if you have any ideas or are interested in working together, please don't hesitate to reach out! Let's learn and grow together.

🎶 Apart from my work in tech, I also have a secret passion for music production 🎧. I produce and mix psychedelic trance music using software like Pure Data and Max 8. My ultimate goal is to combine all of my technologies and interests into one cohesive project.

🙏 Thanks for visiting my GitHub account, and I look forward to connecting with you! 😄
