<!--- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Project to build a humanoid robot 🤖** --->

<p>I'm passionate about technology and love exploring the fascinating world of IoT and embedded systems. Currently, I'm working on a project to build a humanoid robot 🤖, and I'm also diving into the exciting field of bio-neural data analysis 🧠, specifically EEG data samples.</p>
<p>🌱 While I'm still learning, I'm always eager to collaborate and work on projects with others 🤝. So, if you have any ideas or are interested in working together, please don't hesitate to reach out! Let's learn and grow together.</p>
<p>🎶 Apart from my work in tech, I also have a secret passion for music production 🎧. I produce and mix psychedelic trance music using software like Pure Data and Max 8. My ultimate goal is to combine all of my technologies and interests into one cohesive project.</p>
