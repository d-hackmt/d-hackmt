I'm Divesh Jadhwani, a student of MCA specializing in AI and DS. I'm passionate about technology and love exploring the fascinating world of IoT and embedded systems. Currently, I'm working on a project to build a humanoid robot, and I'm also diving into the exciting field of bio-neural data analysis, specifically EEG data samples.

While I'm still learning, I'm always eager to collaborate and work on projects with others. So, if you have any ideas or are interested in working together, please don't hesitate to reach out! Let's learn and grow together.

Apart from my work in tech, I also have a secret passion for music production. I produce and mix psychedelic trance music using software like Pure Data and Max 8. My ultimate goal is to combine all of my technologies and interests into one cohesive project.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub account, and I look forward to connecting with you! ðŸ˜„
